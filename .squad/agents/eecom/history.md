# EECOM — History

## Project Context
- **Project:** FastSaaS — Next-gen Microsoft Commercial Marketplace SaaS accelerator
- **Stack:** Node.js 22, TypeScript, PostgreSQL + Prisma, REST APIs
- **Key concerns:** Azure Marketplace integration, subscription lifecycle, multi-tenancy, metering
- **User:** dkirby-ms

## Active Assignments (Phase 1)

**2026-05-29 — Kranz Triage Decision**

Assigned to EECOM:
- **#1 [BLOCKING]:** API foundation and auth baseline
  - Owner: EECOM
  - Dependencies: None (priority for all backend work)
  - Sequence: Immediate start
  
- **#2 [BLOCKING]:** Subscription lifecycle and fulfillment
  - Owner: EECOM
  - Dependencies: #1 (API routes)
  - Sequence: After #1 ships
  
- **#3 [BLOCKING]:** Metering ingestion and submission
  - Owner: EECOM
  - Dependencies: #1 (API routes)
  - Sequence: Parallel with #2 after #1 ships

**Execution Plan:** Start #1 immediately. After #1 stabilizes, run #2 and #3 in parallel. Coordinate API contracts with FIDO (#4 portal) and GNC (#5 deployment).

## Learnings

- **2026-05-29T14:30:29.387-05:00:** Metering ingestion now uses a tenant-scoped outbox model with derived idempotency keys (`tenant:eventId:timestamp`), retry scheduling for 429/5xx, DLQ capture after retry exhaustion, and a dashboard summary endpoint for SLA timeliness.

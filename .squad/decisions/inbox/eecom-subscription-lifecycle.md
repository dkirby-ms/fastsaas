# EECOM Subscription Lifecycle Decision

- **Date:** 2026-05-29T14:30:29.387-05:00
- **Owner:** EECOM
- **Decision:** Implement subscription lifecycle handling in `packages/api` with a dedicated service and repository boundary, using Prisma-backed persistence when `DATABASE_URL` is configured and an in-memory repository for end-to-end test isolation; route correlation IDs through API and webhook flows into subscription audit records and fulfillment error logs.
- **Rationale:** This keeps the Azure Marketplace fulfillment client, state machine, and persistence concerns decoupled, enables deterministic lifecycle tests without external infrastructure, and preserves a production-ready path to PostgreSQL-backed persistence and auditable webhook processing.

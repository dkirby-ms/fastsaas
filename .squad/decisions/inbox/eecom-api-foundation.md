# EECOM API Foundation Decision

- **Date:** 2026-05-29T14:30:29.387-05:00
- **Owner:** EECOM
- **Decision:** Use an Express + TypeScript workspace package for the backend foundation, with `jose`-based JWT validation, tenant context injection from `tenant_id`/`tid`/`extension_tenant_id`, structured JSON request logging, centralized error handling, and code-annotated OpenAPI publication at `/openapi.json` and `/docs`.
- **Rationale:** This keeps auth and tenant resolution middleware-focused, supports local integration testing with placeholder Azure AD B2C settings, and preserves route contracts for follow-on subscription and metering work.
